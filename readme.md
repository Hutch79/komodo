# <img src="./readmeAssets/img/komodo-512x512.png" width="50" alt="AliasVault"> Komodo

Komodo is a Docker management UI which supports managing Docker containers and compose stacks across dozens of servers.  
In addition to Docker management, Komodo provides tools for building and deploying software, including Git integration, build pipelines and secret management.  

There is no limit to the number of servers you can connect, and there will never be. There is no limit to what API you can use for automation, and there never will be. No "business edition" here.

## How to get started
Komodo needs a MongoDB database to store its data.  
If you're not able to run MongoDB, it is possible to use PostgreSQL with FerretDB *translating* between the two.
